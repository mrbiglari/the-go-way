# Go Learning Archive 📜

## Overview

This repository serves as an **archive and audit trail** of my journey learning Go, following the examples provided on [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/). Each section contains code snippets, notes, and explanations to reinforce my understanding of Go’s features and best practices.

## Project Structure 🌳

```

│   ├── main.go               # The main func allowing debugging of each example
├── README.md                 # A brief summary of the concept covered
```

## Learning Progress 📈

Below is a list of the concepts I have covered so far, with links to my implementations:

- ✅ [Hello World](tutorial/1-hello-world.go/)
- ✅ [Values](tutorial/2-values.go/)
- ✅ [Variables](tutorial/3-variables.go/)
- ✅ [Constants](tutorial/4-constants.go/)
<!--

_(The list will be updated as I progress.)_

## Why This Repo? 🤔

- To track my learning progress with real-world Go examples.
- To document my understanding and revisit concepts later.
- To serve as a reference for others who are also learning Go.
- To practice writing clean, idiomatic Go code.

## Running the Code 🏃

To run any example, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute:

```sh
go run main.go
```
