# Go Learning Archive 📜

## Overview

This repository serves as an **archive and audit trail** of my journey learning Go, following the examples provided on [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/). Each section contains code snippets, notes, and explanations to reinforce my understanding of Go’s features and best practices.

## Structure

Each Go example is organised in a dedicated folder with:

- `README.md` – A brief summary of the concept covered

## Learning Progress 📈

Below is a list of the concepts I have covered so far, with links to my implementations:

- ✅ [Hello World](tutorial/1-hello-world.go/)

<!-- 2. ✅ [Values](examples/02-values/)
2. ✅ [Variables](examples/03-variables/)
3. ✅ [Constants](examples/04-constants/)
4. ✅ [For Loop](examples/05-for/)
5. ✅ [If/Else](examples/06-if-else/)
6. ✅ [Switch](examples/07-switch/)
7. ✅ [Arrays](examples/08-arrays/)
8. ✅ [Slices](examples/09-slices/)
9. ✅ [Maps](examples/10-maps/) -->

- 🔄 [More to Come]

_(The list will be updated as I progress.)_

## Why This Repo? 🤔

- To track my learning progress with real-world Go examples.
- To document my understanding and revisit concepts later.
- To serve as a reference for others who are also learning Go.
- To practice writing clean, idiomatic Go code.

## Running the Code 🏃

To run any example, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute:

```sh
go run main.go
```
